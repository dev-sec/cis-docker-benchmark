It is used for setting the hostname and the domain that is visible to running processes in that namespace. Processes running within containers do not typically require to know hostname and domain name. Hence, the namespace should not be shared with the host.

  Rationale: Sharing the UTS namespace with the host provides full permission to the container to change the hostname of the host. This is insecure and should not be allowed.'

  desc 'Seccomp filtering provides a means for a process to specify a filter for incoming system calls. The default Docker seccomp profile disables 44 system calls, out of 313. It should not be disabled unless it hinders your container application usage.

  Rationale: A large number of system calls are exposed to every userland process with many of them going unused for the entire lifetime of the process. Most of the applications do not need all the system calls and thus benefit by having a reduced set of available system calls. The reduced set of system calls reduces the total kernel surface exposed to the application and thus improvises application security.'

At run-time, it is possible to attach to a different cgroup other than the one that was expected to be used. This usage should be monitored and confirmed.
