  Rationale: Vulnerabilities are loopholes/bugs that can be exploited and security patches are updates to resolve these vulnerabilities. We can use image vulnerability scanning tools to find any kind of vulnerabilities within the images and then check for available patches to mitigate these vulnerabilities. Patches update the system to the most recent code base. Being on the current code base is important because that\'s where vendors focus on fixing problems. Evaluate the security patches before applying and follow the patching best practices. Also, it would be better if, image vulnerability scanning tools could perform binary level analysis or hash based verification instead of just version string matching.'
