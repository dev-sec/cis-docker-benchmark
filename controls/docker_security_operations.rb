  desc 'Perform regular security audits of your host system and containers to identify any mis-configurations or vulnerabilities that could expose your system to compromise.

  Rationale: Performing regular and dedicated security audits of your host systems and containers could provide deep security insights that you might not know in your daily course of business. The identified security weaknesses should be then mitigated and this overall improves security posture of your environment.'

      Capacity Management and Optimization
      Performance Management
      Comprehensive Visibility

  Such a deep visibility of container performance would help you ensure high availability of containers and minimum downtime.'

  desc 'Do not keep a large number of container images on the same host. Use only tagged images as appropriate.

  Rationale: Tagged images are useful to fall back from "latest" to a specific version of an image in production. Images with unused or old tags may contain vulnerabilities that might be exploited, if instantiated. Additionally, if you fail to remove unused images from the system and there are various such redundant and unused images, the host filesystem may become full and could lead to denial of service.'

  title 'Avoid container sprawl'
  desc 'Do not keep a large number of containers on the same host.

  Rationale: The flexibility of containers makes it easy to run multiple instances of applications and indirectly leads to Docker images that exist at varying security patch levels. It also means that you are consuming host resources that otherwise could have been used for running \'useful\' containers. Having more than just the manageable number of containers on a particular host makes the situation vulnerable to mishandling, misconfiguration and fragmentation. Thus, avoid container sprawl and keep the number of containers on a host to a manageable total.'
