  Rationale: By default, unrestricted network traffic is enabled between all containers on the same host. Thus, each container has the potential of reading all packets across the container network on the same host. This might lead to unintended and unwanted disclosure of information to other containers. Hence, restrict the inter container communication.'

  Rationale: Docker will never make changes to your system iptables rules if you choose to do so. Docker server would automatically make the needed changes to iptables based on how you choose your networking options for the containers if it is allowed to do so. It is recommended to let Docker server make changes to iptables automatically to avoid networking misconfiguration that might hamper the communication between containers and to the outside world. Additionally, it would save you hassles of updating iptables every time you choose to run the containers or modify networking options.'

An insecure registry is the one not having either valid registry certificate or is not using TLS. You should not be using any insecure registries in the production environment. Insecure registries can be tampered with leading to possible compromise to your production system. Additionally, If a registry is marked as insecure then \'docker pull\', \'docker push\', and \'docker search\' commands will not result in an error message and the user might be indefinitely working with insecure registries without ever being notified of potential danger.'

  Rationale: By default, Docker daemon binds to a non-networked Unix socket and runs with \'root\' privileges. If you change the default docker daemon binding to a TCP port or any other Unix socket, anyone with access to that port or socket can have full access to Docker daemon and in turn to the host system. Hence, you should not bind the Docker daemon to another IP/port or a Unix socket. If you must expose the Docker daemon via a network socket, configure TLS authentication for the daemon and Docker Swarm APIs (if using). This would restrict the connections to your Docker daemon over the network to a limited number of clients who could successfully authenticate over TLS.'

  Rationale: ulimit provides control over the resources available to the shell and to processes started by it. Setting system resource limits judiciously saves you from many disasters such as a fork bomb. Sometimes, even friendly users and legitimate processes can overuse system resources and in-turn can make the system unusable. Setting default ulimit for the Docker daemon would enforce the ulimit for all container instances. You would not need to setup ulimit for each container instance. However, the default ulimit can be overridden during container runtime, if needed. Hence, to control the system resources, define a default ulimit as needed in your environment.'

If container images that you are using have a pre-defined non-root user, this recommendation may be skipped since this feature is still in its infancy and might give you unpredictable issues and complexities.

  Rationale: The Linux kernel user namespace support in Docker daemon provides additional security for the Docker host system. It allows a container to have a unique range of user and group IDs which are outside the traditional user and group range utilized by the host system. For example, the root user will have expected administrative privilege inside the container but can effectively be mapped to an unprivileged UID on the host system.'

  Rationale: The base device size can be increased at daemon restart. Increasing the base device size allows all future images and containers to be of the new base device size. A user can use this option to expand the base device size however shrinking is not permitted. This value affects the system-wide “base” empty filesystem that may already be initialized and inherited by pulled images. Though the file system does not allot the increased size if it is empty, it will use more space for the empty case depending upon the device size. This may cause a denial of service by ending up in file system being over-allocated or full.'

  Rationale: When Docker restarts, both the TLS key used to encrypt communication among swarm nodes, and the key used to encrypt and decrypt Raft logs on disk, are loaded into each manager node\'s memory. You should protect the mutual TLS encryption key and the key used to encrypt and decrypt Raft logs at rest. This protection could be enabled by initializing swarm with --autolock flag. With --autolock enabled, when Docker restarts, you must unlock the swarm first, using a key encryption key generated by Docker when the swarm was initialized.'

  desc 'Rotate swarm manager auto-lock key periodically.

  Rationale: Swarm manager auto-lock key is not automatically rotated. You should rotate them periodically as a best practice.

  Audit: Currently, there is no mechanism to find out when the key was last rotated on a swarm manager node. You should check with the system administrator if there is a key rotation record and the keys were rotated at a pre-defined frequency.'
